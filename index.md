__Sigmyne__ provides custom astronomical data reduction, observatory and telescope control solutions, mainly for ground-based and airborne far-infrared observatories since 2016. Past and present contracts include providing the imaging pipeline for NASA's [HAWC+](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SOFIA/docs/instruments/hawc/) and [HIRMES](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12673) instruments aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Far-Infrared Astronomy ([SOFIA](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/sofia/)), the science and onboard data reduction pipelines for the upcoming [POEMM mission](https://poemm.astro.cornell.edu/), and providing the [MIT Haystack 37-m](https://www.haystack.mit.edu/37m) telescope with a control system.

__Sigmyne__ is founded and run by [Attila Kov&aacute;cs](https://www.simyne.com/attila) (A.B. Harvard 1997; PhD Caltech 2006) with 30 years of experience with far-infrared astronomy, radio telescopes, instrumentation and detector development; 20+ years of experience with developing new data reduction and imaging techniques &amp; pipelines ([CRUSH](https://www.sigmyne.com/crush), and 10+ years of experience with observatory control systems, including being the senior real-time software developer of the Submillimeter Array ([SMA](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/)) at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard &amp; Smithsonian 2017-2026.

Beyond custom software, __Sigmyne__ also publishes free and open-source software, such as the [SuperNOVAS](https://sigmyne.github.io/SuperNOVAS/) C/C++ high-precision astrometry library; the [xchange](https://sigmyne.github.io/xchange/) C/C++ library for hierarchical data representation (including a JSON parser and emitter); the [RedisX](https://sigmyne.github.io/redisx/) library and toolkit (a C/C++ Redis / Valkey client); the [smax-clib](https://sigmyne.github.io/smax-lib/) C/C++ library that provides a rich hierarchical data storage in a Redis / Valkey database; and the [smax-postgress](https://sigmyne.github.io/smax-postgres) tool for logging such a real-time database into a PostgreSQL time series to create a history. Naturally, all of these components can be used (are used) as parts of a telescope control system, but they can support other applications also.
